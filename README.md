# Gravity Forms List Field Validations
Program to validate multiple-field list fields in Wordpress/Gravity Forms : Name, Phone Number, Email Address


Getting Started
----------------

Updated copy of Wordpress and Gravity Forms plugin must be present.


Installing
----------

Clone or download the repository from github

`git clone https://github.com/ckyoga/gravity-form-validations.git`


Checkout this repository and place the “gravity-form-validations” code in your wordpress theme's function.php file.

Function Name: "gform_field_validation_23_110"

In this example form-id is 23 and field-id is 110.   Please update the function name with the current form-id and field-id.

Why Did I Write this Program?
------------------------------

The Gravity Forms plugin does not provide error checking against every field in a list.  This basic function will validate a list field with Name, Email and Phone Number and provide an error message, if necessary.
